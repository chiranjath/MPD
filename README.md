This project uses image proccesinig technique called Histogram of Gradients and firebase as the databse to identify missing people in a crowd and return if theyre missing or not.
Here my code uploads the image to firebaase as error if it doesnt exist not missing if the person isnt in database or missing if they are and stores the missing image and current image both locally and in the db
